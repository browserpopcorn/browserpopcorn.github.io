"Everest (2015)" ^ (Run time : 01:49:25)

2
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:14,634
Based on a true story.

3
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:20,640
Enmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the
first mountaineers to reach the summit of Everest.

4
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:25,645
Over the next 40 years. Professional, expert
mountaineers tried to accomplish the same feat.

5
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,565
One in four died

6
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:32,444
1992:
New Zealander, Rob Hall created the concept of guided
commercial expeditions to Everest for amateur mountaineers.

7
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:36,364
During the next 4 years, his team, "Adventure Consultants"
successfully guided 19 clients to the summit,

8
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:38,950
without a single death.

9
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:44,456
1996:
Other commercial operators follow the example of Rob Hall,
including "Mountain Madness", by Scott Fischer.

10
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:49,711
Completing over 20 expeditions to reach the summit
of Everest in the same period of 2 weeks

11
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,714
Please listen up.

12
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:55,133
Guys.

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,136
We got 2000 feet,

14
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:00,305
600 vertical metres (m)

15
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:02,432
to Camp 4.

16
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,643
Let's rope all the way,

17
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,811
so I know you can make it.

18
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,148
Alright, once we get to the
Yellow band, we're going to regroup.

19
00:02:10,148 --> 00:02:12,984
Put on the mask,
turn on the gas.

20
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:14,819
Make sense?

21
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,582
$325 a bottle,

22
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:09,541
- for oxygen.
(6 weeks ago...)

23
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,585
- It's daylight robbery.
(6 weeks ago...)

24
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,670
Yeah. Well, he's corner the market,
he's got it

25
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:16,798
He reckon there's going to be
20 teams at Base camp this season.

26
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,217
- 20 teams?
- I mean with all the Sherpas and porters

27
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:21,595
it's going to be
squeeze up there.

28
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:24,890
Lets...
scrum on the ropes right there.

29
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,057
What is this?

30
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:27,184
It's Helen's.

31
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:29,060
It's a little decoration
for the mess in.

32
00:03:29,102 --> 00:03:31,354
- Hey, you can wear them on your head, y'hear.
- I'll have it, thank you.

33
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:33,648
Okay, I got some news.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,150
- We got Krakauer.
- Huh?

35
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,276
Oh, yeah!

36
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:38,820
- You stole him from Scott Fischer.
- No, he made his own mind.

37
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,697
Good job, Rob.

38
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:43,700
How much is he paying you, Rob?

39
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:46,203
Well, he's...
only paying for his airfare.

40
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:48,079
but we got 5000 words

41
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:51,082
in the magazine and our picture
in the front cover.  Huh.

42
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:53,752
That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.

43
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,212
Or if you get him to the top.

44
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:58,215
If... If...
How can you say that to me?

45
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,633
Here you go, I got you.
You alright?

46
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,092
Thanks, Guy.
Cheers, mate.

47
00:04:01,092 --> 00:04:03,345
- Hey.
- Hi, Rob.

48
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:06,139
- You alright?
- Oh, yeah. How are you?

49
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:08,934
- I am good. Oh, look at you.
- I know.

50
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,644
- Big.
- Here you go.

51
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:11,645
You good?

52
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:12,812
- Yeh, you know.
- Okay.

53
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,523
Just going to miss you.

54
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,444
Let's go, Guy.

55
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:22,822
Just-Just go careful, alright?

56
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:24,699
- It's just...
- Please don't.

57
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:26,826
Come on, please don't worry.

58
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:29,538
It's just that doing nothing back here
that's making me worry.

59
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:32,249
- You're not doing nothing.
- No, but...

60
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:33,917
What?

61
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,586
It's the waiting for you.

62
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,797
- For him.
- Ha ha.

63
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,924
- Her.
- Her.

64
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:46,471
Just, be back for the birth,
Rob Hall.

65
00:04:47,222 --> 00:04:49,558
You try and stop me.

66
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:56,273
- Okay, I love you.
- Go, or I'll cry.

67
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:57,941
Go.

68
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,837
KATHMANDU, NEPAL

69
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:21,840
30th March 1996

70
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,383
Here.

71
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,136
- That all you got.
- Yeah. That's it.

72
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:28,471
I think we're over here.

73
00:05:36,688 --> 00:05:39,316
Hey...
What work outfit you guys with?

74
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:41,902
- Adventure Consultants.
- Uh, good, me too.

75
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:43,528
I'm Beck.
Beck Weathers.

76
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,030
Doug Hansen.

77
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,865
- Jon Krakauer.
- How're you doing?

78
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,241
- Okay.
- Are you...

79
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:50,452
Krakauer from Outside magazine.

80
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:52,162
- Yeah.
- Really?

81
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:54,331
What're you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?

82
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:56,291
A little bit of both.

83
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,419
Well. I'll let you know
how the Summit goes, okay?

84
00:05:59,461 --> 00:06:03,006
- No need, I'll be there.
- We'll see.

85
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,815
What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?

86
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:22,734
- What? Work?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:25,487
Uh, different things.
Carpenter, mailman.

88
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,406
- Carpenter, mailman.
- Yep.

89
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:32,410
- Seriously, you deliver the mail?
- Yep, I deliver the mail.

90
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,455
Mailman on Everest?

91
00:06:35,455 --> 00:06:38,250
- Hope so.
- Ha ha. I like that.

92
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,252
Mailman on Everest.

93
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:49,386
There we go.

94
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:50,887
- There.
- Yeah.

95
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:53,181
You know, he made it to the
South Summit on Everest last year.

96
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,433
- Who? Doug did?
- Yeah.

97
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:59,020
- That's pretty hot for a mailman.
- Yep

98
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:01,523
Brown's Peak,
McKinley.

99
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:04,442
I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.

100
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,485
I know.

101
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:08,280
- How did you know that?
- 89', right?

102
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:11,408
Ohhh.
You done your research.

103
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:13,285
That's what we do.

104
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,462
You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.

105
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:26,673
A histroy made famous
by George Everest,

106
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:29,718
George Mallory, Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary...

107
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,844
- And Rob Hall.
- lege...

108
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:32,888
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:35,265
legend... lege...
legends, all of them.

110
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:37,184
- Ha-ha-ha...
- Eh ha ha...

111
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,935
That's right.

112
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:40,979
For those of you who dare
face the dreams,

113
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,692
Adventure Consultants offer something
beyond the power of words to describe.

114
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:48,486
And why don't we
describe it in the brochure.

115
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:52,282
Because it's mostly just pain.

116
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:53,575
- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth.

117
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:55,327
And the odd,
if you don't mind, Mike.

118
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:58,163
And the odd missing toe.

119
00:07:58,872 --> 00:07:59,998
There we go.

120
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,374
- Oh...
- Uuu...

121
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,168
To put it simply, guys.

122
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,171
Human beings
simply aren't built to function

123
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:10,133
at the cruising altitude of a 747.

124
00:08:10,342 --> 00:08:13,720
Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Col.

125
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:17,015
Our bodies will be literally dying
and I mean literally dying.

126
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:19,184
It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.

127
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:22,687
So, the game is,
can we get you up to the top

128
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:26,024
and down to the bottom
before that happens.

129
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,652
- You sure can.
- Oh.

130
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,111
Beck Weathers,
ladies and gentlemen.

131
00:08:30,153 --> 00:08:32,197
You might've noticed he's a
bit of a lone star state.

132
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:36,535
100% Texan right here, people.
100% Texan.

133
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:38,954
You met Mike Groom.

134
00:08:39,287 --> 00:08:41,456
I like to introduce you to Andy Harris.
- Or Harold.

135
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:43,041
Harold had got out of Queenstown.

136
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,085
Taranaki actually,
originally Canada.

137
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:47,254
Helen and the rest of the team are
already on their way up to Base Camp.

138
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:49,714
They're setting it up
when we get there.

139
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:51,591
- Today is March 30th, people.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,802
I plan on going to
the Summit, May 10th.

141
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,054
It's been a lucky day for me
in Adventure Consultants,

142
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:58,723
and the weather is usually
pretty stable around then.

143
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:00,058
So that means,

144
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,812
We have 40 days,
to train your bodies and your minds

145
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,063
to go for it.

146
00:09:05,063 --> 00:09:08,024
Now. I know there is a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room

147
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,484
you wouldn't be here without it.

148
00:09:09,526 --> 00:09:12,445
- Stu, K2, Broad Peak.
- Nice.

149
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:16,658
John Taske,
1192m of Mount Kosciuszko.

150
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,826
- Ha ha ha...
- Eh ha ha...

151
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:20,287
- And Yasuko Namba.
- Oh.

152
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,663
- 6 of the 7 Summits.
- Yeah.

153
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:23,707
- An amazing woman.
- There you go.

154
00:09:23,748 --> 00:09:25,375
- Let's make it 7.
- Thank you.

155
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:29,087
But, Everest though, is another beast.
Another beast altogether.

156
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,922
That's why you're here.
Isn't that right, Dougy.

157
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:34,009
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

158
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,594
So, listen.
Tonight, that's it for me.

159
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:39,222
Eat, drink, be merry.
Tomorrow we trek.

160
00:09:41,391 --> 00:09:43,518
Alright, let's go.

161
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:49,149
Alright, folks, hang on.

162
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:50,233
Okay.

163
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:51,693
That's it.
Here we go, colonel

164
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:53,486
Alright, everybody, earbuds.

165
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:55,572
Take your seats.
Buckle in, everyone.

166
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,157
Thanks, bud.

167
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,492
Here we go.

168
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:28,563
Lukla : 2,860 metres

169
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:39,533
Take it easy.

170
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,161
- Ready.
- Let's go.

171
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,038
You lead the way.

172
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:47,958
- Are you alright?
- Come on, man.

173
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,576
Namche Bazzar : 3,750 metres

174
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,870
Guys, man want to see
your climbing permits.

175
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,455
Need to see all
your climbing permits.

176
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,042
Thank you very much.
We'll see you on the way back.

177
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,711
Thank you very much.

178
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:35,046
- All good?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you?

179
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:37,299
- Yeah.
- Hey...

180
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,967
Thanks, Rob.

181
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:42,470
- Thanks for what?
- You know, the discount.

182
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,849
You're working 3 jobs, Doug.

183
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:47,392
It's the least I can do, right?

184
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:51,062
I know you didn't have to do it.
I appreciated it.

185
00:11:52,063 --> 00:11:53,648
Let's just get you
to the top this time.

186
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,442
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:57,068
Yeah.

188
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:07,704
How're you feeling, Beck?

189
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,081
About a third to midland.

190
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:11,875
Come on, buddy.
You can do it.

191
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,211
Thought I was going to
acclimatise faster than this.

192
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:16,213
Uh.
You'll be alright.

193
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,425
Go on, critters

194
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,192
Woo.

195
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:40,362
- Well.
- Yeah.

196
00:12:45,617 --> 00:12:46,993
How close did you get?

197
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:48,870
I got really close,
but...

198
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:52,290
got a lateness ,
pretty shot anyways, so...

199
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,460
I think I would have
made a run for it.

200
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,296
- Everyday I wake up thinking that.
- Then why didn't you do it?

201
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:00,465
Because I turned him around.

202
00:13:00,632 --> 00:13:02,300
1:15 (PM) of the South Summit.

203
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,762
That condition, we weren't going to
make that 2 PM turn around.

204
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:07,681
It's all good more you make
the top, Beck.

205
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:10,267
but you pay me
to bring you down safely.

206
00:13:10,308 --> 00:13:11,893
Remember that.

207
00:13:12,894 --> 00:13:14,521
Okay.

208
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,115
What's eating him?

209
00:13:25,991 --> 00:13:28,743
One of those Sherpas is Tenzing.
He had an accident.

210
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,996
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:33,331
... on the icefall.

212
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:36,168
It's not good,
had to bring him down.

213
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:55,478
Tengboche Monastery : 3,867 metres

214
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:18,084
Blessing at Tengboche Monastery

215
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:33,433
Climbers Memorial, Thok La : 4,877 metres

216
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:16,977
South Base Camp Of Everest : 5,367 metres

217
00:15:18,603 --> 00:15:20,689
Look what happens.

218
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:23,316
Yeah. Didn't take you too long
to get in on the act.

219
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:25,610
Got to make a living, man.

220
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,698
You... went ahead and
fixed the ice post, I see.

221
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:32,325
Yeah, yeah.
It's pretty messy up there this year.

222
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:33,869
- Yeah?
- The vasses are pretty big.

223
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,037
Strung 4 or 5 ladders across.

224
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,123
You use good ropes there, did you?

225
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:40,333
You ready?
Okay.

226
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,795
This is April 7th about 10:30 am

227
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:46,756
This is Sandy Hill Pittman reporting
for Nbc Interactive Media

228
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:50,635
and we are official at
Everest Base Camp.

229
00:15:50,635 --> 00:15:52,554
- She one of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

230
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:56,433
Someone went and stole my journalist
so I had to get another one.

231
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:59,227
She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer, that's for sure.

232
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:01,021
Listen, just to be clear
I didn't steal your journalist.

233
00:16:01,062 --> 00:16:02,439
Hey, man.
It's all good.

234
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,649
- Outside magazine gave me a call...
- Hey.

235
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:06,151
- They gave me a call...
- Hey!

236
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:08,278
-  said they wanted...
- It's all good.

237
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,905
they're going to sent
a journalist up the hill

238
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:12,240
and asked me if
I was interested.

239
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:15,535
It was his call in the end.

240
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,672
Alright.
Carol Mackenzie, team doctor.

241
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:29,299
Why don't you kick it off, Carol.

242
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,051
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Carol.

243
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:32,552
Hi, there.

244
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:36,473
- Hey, sorry.
- No, it's fine.

245
00:16:36,515 --> 00:16:39,100
Um. So...
Rob and Harold and Mike

246
00:16:39,142 --> 00:16:41,770
will tell you all sorts of stuff
about mountaineering.

247
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:44,022
but, from a medical stand of point,

248
00:16:44,022 --> 00:16:47,442
getting into the top of Everest
was really about oxygen.

249
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,069
and the lack of it.

250
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,154
To give you the best chance
of summiting,

251
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:54,491
you need to prepare your bodies
for the thin air up there.

252
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:57,202
So, over the next month
before the final ascend,

253
00:16:57,244 --> 00:17:00,163
you are going to make
3 partial acclimatising ascends,

254
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:03,291
returning here, to Base Camp,
after each one.

255
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:07,671
The bad news is that each ascend
begins and ends with the icefall.

256
00:17:07,712 --> 00:17:10,715
I'm sorry,
but there's no way around it.

257
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:15,554
There're millions of tons of glacier ice
continue moving day and night.

258
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:20,892
Your crevasses so deep
they probably don't have a bottom.

259
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:23,311
It is not a place that you want to
get caught hanging out on,

260
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:25,230
especially when the sun hits it.

261
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,733
So, we're going to be up, nice and early
and through that as soon as possible.

262
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,361
Now, the Sherpas are going ahead and
fixed the ladders across the crevasses

263
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,030
and we've made it
as safe as we possibly can.

264
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,908
But, that is not to say
that it is completely safe.

265
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:39,578
19 people have died
in that icefall.

266
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:43,123
- Whoa whoa whoa...
- Hold on.

267
00:17:43,832 --> 00:17:45,375
Steady.

268
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,128
- You alright, Jon?
- You alright?

269
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:51,423
- I'm good. Okay.
- Alright, steady up.

270
00:17:51,464 --> 00:17:54,050
So, remember,
we're a team,

271
00:17:54,092 --> 00:17:56,011
let's look up for each other.

272
00:17:56,052 --> 00:17:58,763
- Lookout for hypothermia.
(Camp 1 : 5,944 metres)

273
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:02,559
Things like slur speech
and irrational behaviour.

274
00:18:02,601 --> 00:18:04,978
I've seen hypoxia climbers
ripped off all their clothes

275
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,148
at 8000 m because
they are feeling hot.

276
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:12,319
You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brain

277
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,573
to the point of lost of motor function
and eventually death.

278
00:18:17,157 --> 00:18:20,368
And pulmonary edema, which is
your lungs filling with fluid.

279
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,621
till you furtively drown.

280
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:25,999
The only cure is to get
down the mountain fast.

281
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,626
Alright. Okay.
Alright.

282
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,128
But, it is not all doom
and gloom here, okay?

283
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:33,798
Myself and the whole AC team are here
to make sure you get up and down safely

284
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:36,760
and you will acclimatise naturally.

285
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,679
So, why don't we all
give Carol a nice big thank you.

286
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,264
- Oh, you don't have to give me that.
- It's her first time here.

287
00:18:41,306 --> 00:18:42,599
- Hey.
- Alright.

288
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:44,267
Nice job.

289
00:18:45,018 --> 00:18:48,480
23th April

290
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:54,528
Camp 2 : 6,492 metres

291
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:56,363
Well done.

292
00:18:57,155 --> 00:19:00,492
You want to get on the regulator
or you want to hear that

293
00:19:02,077 --> 00:19:03,328
Can it get hosed.

294
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:04,830
Guys, go.

295
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,957
- How're you doing, darling?
- Okay.

296
00:19:06,957 --> 00:19:07,999
- Good?
- Yeah.

297
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,918
- Well done.
- Hang in there.

298
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,214
In a situation like this,
you just want to catch your breath

299
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,424
go right up to 4, you should
start feeling pretty good.

300
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:17,634
Yeah, I can feel that already.

301
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,135
How did you boys go?

302
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:20,720
- Instant happiness.
- Hey.

303
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,348
- Amazing.
- Very happy.

304
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,770
- Doug, you okay?
- Huh?

305
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,273
When we get back to base,
I want you to...

306
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:32,524
get Carol to get
a look at you.

307
00:19:32,524 --> 00:19:33,817
Nah, I'm alright.
I'm okay.

308
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:36,862
Then... do me a favor,
swinge another oxygen.

309
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,196
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

310
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:40,490
- You got enough?
- We got plenty.

311
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,033
Alright.

312
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,036
Get some tea in there.

313
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,747
Just lift your shirt up a bit.

314
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,332
Thank you.

315
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:54,462
Now, take a deep breath for me.

316
00:20:00,385 --> 00:20:01,761
Just take one of those
in the morning

317
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:04,890
- with a little bit of water before breakfast.
- Okay. thanks.

318
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:06,558
- Right, Beck. You're up.
- It's alright.

319
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:08,476
You're right.
Go for it.

320
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,730
Read it and weep.

321
00:20:12,147 --> 00:20:14,065
Take it easy there.

322
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:18,904
- Right, you can stop.
- Yeah?

323
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:21,406
- You're in great shape, Beck.
- I'm in great shape.

324
00:20:21,448 --> 00:20:23,533
- Yeah.
- 6 days a week in the gym

325
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:25,785
- ought to do it.
- Your wife must have love that.

326
00:20:25,785 --> 00:20:27,787
Yeah, she does.

327
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,582
Oh no.
What's the date today?

328
00:20:30,582 --> 00:20:33,084
- April 25th.
- No.

329
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:34,961
No...

330
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:41,801
Need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?

331
00:20:41,843 --> 00:20:45,180
You might want to look at this one first,
came in for you last night.

332
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:49,851
Happy Anniversary Beck
- Peach.

333
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,019
Oh, Lord.

334
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:52,270
What?

335
00:20:53,313 --> 00:20:55,065
Can I-Can I use your satphone?

336
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:58,610
Woo. This came in last night,
it is an emergency?

337
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,029
- It's...  25 bucks a minute, Beck.
- Yeah, fine.

338
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:04,157
- No. This one is on us.
- Seriously.

339
00:21:04,157 --> 00:21:05,742
Thanks.

340
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:08,537
Rob.

341
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:12,290
- Beck?
- Peach, it's me.

342
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:13,834
What happened?

343
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,961
Nothing. Nothing.
I'm fine.

344
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:18,296
Where-Where are you?

345
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,341
I'm at Base Camp right now.

346
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:23,385
You're calling me from Everest?

347
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:25,095
Yeah, it's a satellite phone, honey.

348
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:27,305
Oh my god.
How much is that costing?

349
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:31,017
- What's the problem?
- There is no problem, Peach.

350
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:33,895
I'm sorry, we were
up at Camp 2 and

351
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:37,148
that's why I didn't send
you a fax yesterday.

352
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:41,820
Happy anniversary.
Okay.

353
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,363
- Get off.
- Mom.

354
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,991
- How're the kids?
- Fine.

355
00:21:46,032 --> 00:21:47,492
- Hey.
- Peach.

356
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:49,744
- Get off.
- Bud's here.

357
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,290
Doing his homework
in the morning as per usual.

358
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,791
You want to say hi to him?

359
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,084
Yeah, of course I do.

360
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:57,252
- Hang on.
- Okay.

361
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:58,336
- Say hi.
- Hey, Dad.

362
00:21:58,336 --> 00:21:59,504
- Hey, Bud.
- Hi.

363
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:01,339
I miss you, buddy.

364
00:22:01,548 --> 00:22:03,967
Oh.
And Meg went on her first date.

365
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:06,386
- Mom.
- ...last weekend. Well, you did.

366
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:09,097
- Wow. Really?
- Um-hum.

367
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,141
- Get off.
- Peach.

368
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:15,520
I missed you, honey.

369
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:17,814
Mom?
Mom.

370
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,816
Missed the kids...

371
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:23,153
a lot.

372
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,658
- Peach.
- Listen, I got to get the kids to school.

373
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,869
I got to run.

374
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,455
Okay.

375
00:22:33,497 --> 00:22:35,207
Yeah.
Go careful.

376
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,958
Bye bye.

377
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,838
Is Dad okay?

378
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:45,050
Just... he never calls.

379
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,510
He's...

380
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,012
I think he's scared.

00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,274
Yeah.

384
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:03,568
Beck.
Come in mate, come on.

385
00:23:04,194 --> 00:23:06,780
- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.

386
00:23:07,614 --> 00:23:10,075
You don't dance.
You don't climb.

387
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,743
Come on, guys.
Beck Weathers.

388
00:23:11,785 --> 00:23:13,912
- Yeah.
- Come on, Beck. Come on.

389
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:18,750

00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,427
Hey, man.
Breaking into the rations?

393
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:30,804
Yeah, you want some?

394
00:23:30,804 --> 00:23:33,890
No. I'll...
I'll wait till we summit.

395
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:37,435
I don't know about that, Neal.

396
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:39,938
We'll get there.

397
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:41,356
I'm excited.

398
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:45,193
Anyway, me and Anatoli are here
to help you, you know.

399
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:49,865
It's too much competition.

400
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,204
We don't need competition
between people.

401
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:03,962
This competition,
between every person and this mountain.

402
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:10,468
The last word always
belongs to the mountain.

403
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:26,651
Lhotse Face : 7,132 metres

404
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:36,495
- Ang Dorjee.
- Yeah!

405
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:39,164
Stay there, Beck.
Stay there.

406
00:24:39,331 --> 00:24:41,541
Okay, I'm coming down.

407
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,133
This isn't happening, guys.

408
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:52,886
Let's turn him around.

409
00:24:53,512 --> 00:24:55,555
Get him off the Face,
and back to the Base Camp

410
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:56,765
Turn around.

411
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:59,684
- Ang Dorjee. Come on, we're going down.
- Okay.

412
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,608
My hand!

413
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:11,029
Okay, make a fist again.
Just kind of keep clenching

414
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:12,948
to keep the blood flow.

415
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:17,327
What's going on, man?

416
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:19,704
Still waiting for the south Africans.

417
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:22,541
Carl took forever as well.

418
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,878
Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.

419
00:25:26,878 --> 00:25:29,923
Yeah, yeah.
Your yak fun money is coming.

420
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:33,802
- You serious man?
- Come on. Get a move on.

421
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:42,435
- How long you're been waiting him?
- A good 45 minutes.

422
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:44,813
- Man, it's freezing.
- Yeah.

423
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:46,898
- Stinging, huh?
- Yeah.

424
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:49,901
- Hey, Rob, we got to get him over!
- We're working on it.

425
00:25:49,901 --> 00:25:51,903
He's freezing, man.

426
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,865
- Are you set?
- Yeah.

427
00:25:54,906 --> 00:25:57,742
- We're sending him over, mate.
- Go ahead.

428
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,251
Keep going, Beck.

429
00:26:06,251 --> 00:26:08,003
Looking good.

430
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:18,263
- That's it.
- Now, head up, mate. Head up.

431
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:36,948
Hold on there!

432
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:38,200
- Whoaaaa.
- Pull. Pull.

433
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:40,785
Help. Help!
Help!

434
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:42,746
Beck, you alright?

435
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:44,372
- Are these ladders going to take 2.
- Yeah.

436
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:45,916
I'll get a rope.
I'll belay you, okay!

437
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:48,418
- Stay right where you are, mate.
- I can't pull yourself up!

438
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,795
I'm going to come after you.

439
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:53,465
Good-Good, Beck.
You're okay.

440
00:26:53,882 --> 00:26:55,258
Untie these,
you got to tie me in.

441
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,384
Come and get me.

442
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:57,802
- On belay.
- Got it, on belay.

443
00:26:57,802 --> 00:26:59,137
Let's go.

444
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm coming after you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.

445
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:09,981
Nice and easy,

446
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:13,610
- I can't feel my hands!
- Looking good.

447
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:14,653
Help me.

448
00:27:14,653 --> 00:27:15,695
- Beck. Beck. Beck.
- Help me!

449
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,280
Stay right where you are, mate.

450
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,615
- Can't pull myself up.
- I'm right here. I'm here.

451
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:20,534
I can't pull myself up!

452
00:27:31,002 --> 00:27:32,671
You okay?

453
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:36,049
No guarantees to the Summit.
I get it.

454
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:40,428
I get killed because I'm waiting in line.
Like I'm in a freaking Wal-mart.

455
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:43,765
Not while I paid you $65,000

456
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:46,184
Now get me off of here.

457
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:50,856
That's it.
Plant your feet, one at a time.

458
00:27:56,945 --> 00:27:59,114
Alright, thanks for coming by.
(Meeting for guides, organizers)

459
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:02,367
Look. Base Camp as you know
is chalked up all this year, so...

460
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:04,578
I think it'll
all benefit us greatly

461
00:28:04,578 --> 00:28:06,371
by coming together like this
and you know,

462
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:08,373
working out some kind
of plan and schedule.

463
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:10,959
- What, like some kind of rotor?
- Yes.

464
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,711
On Everest.

465
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:17,340
Everyone knows Everest is a business for you,
but, Rob, are you kidding?

466
00:28:17,382 --> 00:28:19,926
What gives you the right to tell us
when we can climb and when we can't.

467
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,053
I'm not telling you,
I'm asking.

468
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:24,431
We know everybody is planning to summit,
for instance...

469
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:28,101
You know we can avoid the chaos
that happened at the Icefall today.

470
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:30,729
Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10th.

471
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,063
So are we, man.

472
00:28:32,063 --> 00:28:34,482
- Us too.
- May 10th.

473
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:39,362
Okay, that's bumper to bumper traffic
on the Hillary step.

474
00:28:39,404 --> 00:28:40,697
Yes it is, that's my point.

475
00:28:40,697 --> 00:28:44,159
Look, this is ridiculous.
We summiting when we want.

476
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:48,163
Alright. And I don't need
your permission to climb the mountain.

477
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:50,081
Ian, have you seen how
many people here

478
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:51,208
- ... at Base Camp this year.
- We're finish here.

479
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:54,085
- Come on, lads.
- Hey, man.

480
00:29:09,476 --> 00:29:11,436
Ah.
Come in, man.

481
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:12,812
- Hi.
- Ha ha.

482
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:15,273
- Have a drink, Rob.
- Yeah, have a drink.

483
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:16,691
Na zdorovye. (*To health.)

484
00:29:16,733 --> 00:29:19,194
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)
- Nostrovia.  (*Cheers)

485
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:21,905
- With a word. Yeh.
- Um-hum.

486
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:29,830
- You're a little crook, huh.
- I know, it's just a little.

487
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,458
- A little touch of the deli belly.
- He means Buddha belly.

488
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:40,340
What's going on Roberto?

489
00:29:47,764 --> 00:29:50,976
I don't like the look of the
crowds on the ropes.

490
00:29:51,393 --> 00:29:54,688
We will run into some trouble
once we're above Camp 3.

491
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:57,440
- Well. You want the top of number 10, yeah?
- Yeah.

492
00:29:57,482 --> 00:29:58,984
So do I.

493
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:02,487
What're you saying,
we should team up?

494
00:30:02,487 --> 00:30:04,823
Well, it's an idea, yeah.

495
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:07,993
Oh, man.

496
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:14,541
Oh, I don't know, man.
We have different styles, man. Like...

497
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,294
All due respect,
you're a hand holder.

498
00:30:17,294 --> 00:30:19,838
I mean the best, but...

499
00:30:19,838 --> 00:30:22,174
I just believe that if you can't
get up there yourself

500
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:24,676
you shouldn't be on
the mountain at all.

501
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:27,470
You guide your team,
I guide my.

502
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:30,807
I'm just suggesting that we work
with each other instead of against.

503
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:34,227
The only way we both summit, mate,
is that we work together.

504
00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:36,730
Particularly fixing the ropes.

505
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,274
It's got to make sense.

506
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,486
Ah.

507
00:30:45,614 --> 00:30:47,324
Why not.

508
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,952
- Oh Yeah.
- Yeah, I see the sense in it.

509
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:52,204
Okay then.

510
00:30:52,204 --> 00:30:54,664
- Thanks, Scott.
- Alright.

511
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:57,459
Who's going to lead
when we get up there.

512
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:05,550
Rob, if I say I want to lead,
could it be done?

513
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,389
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Okay, hey.

514
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:14,726
You got to work with Ang Dorjee.
'cause we're working together now.

515
00:31:15,477 --> 00:31:19,981
He's just saying if both of us...
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

516
00:31:20,482 --> 00:31:21,775
Okay.

517
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:23,860
Ang Dorjee.

518
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:26,738
We're all professionals here.

519
00:31:26,738 --> 00:31:28,406
We work together and
we get the job done.

520
00:31:28,406 --> 00:31:30,242
- Yes?
- Alright, yeah.

521
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:33,203
We're planning of stashing,
what 8 bottles of "O"

522
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:34,538
over the South Summit.

523
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:36,873
- Well, I'm not using "O".
- What do you mean?

524
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:38,917
- You're not using oxygen at all?
- Come on man, you know you want it.

525
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,585
In his care, don't need it.

526
00:31:40,627 --> 00:31:43,213
Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

527
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:45,423
You have people's lives in your hands.
It's your job.

528
00:31:45,423 --> 00:31:48,260
Never used it.
Never will.

529
00:31:48,426 --> 00:31:51,054
Bigger problems if you run out.

530
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:53,098
Okay.

531
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,808
I'll put some more bottles
over up there.

532
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,977
- You know, that would be good.
- Alright.

533
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,520
Just as long as you guys are clear.

534
00:31:58,562 --> 00:32:01,273
You work for me you use oxygen,
otherwise you don't work for me.

535
00:32:01,314 --> 00:32:02,607
Hey, you don't have to ask me.

536
00:32:02,607 --> 00:32:06,069
I've been up here before without "O"s, Rob.
I don't need to deal with clients.

537
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:08,238
- Alright. Next we have the fixed ropes.
- Yeah.

538
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,158
Particularly, above the Lhotse Face.

539
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,909
You let us start
make new fixed rope.

540
00:32:12,951 --> 00:32:14,828
- And Southeast Ridge as well.
- Yes, it does.

541
00:32:14,828 --> 00:32:16,997
Well. My idea is that
we work together

542
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:19,332
and we fix ropes together,
we share the duties.

543
00:32:19,374 --> 00:32:20,542
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

544
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,127
Alright, you and Lopsang
maybe get together,

545
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:25,297
talk about who want to
fix what and where, okay?

546
00:32:25,463 --> 00:32:27,215
Ah.
Only essentials.

547
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:30,468
I'm not going to tell you what to pack,
but be brutal, okay.

548
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:33,471
1 pint down here
is like 10 up there.

549
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:36,683
Light and fast.
Light and fast.

550
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:40,770
What, and just like that
you-you killed my summit cappuccino.

551
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,607
Go go go.
Run.

552
00:32:43,648 --> 00:32:46,234
That camera is totally daine.
( 5th May )

553
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,487
Alright, it's going to be a tough week.
( 5th May )

554
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:51,865
But, it's going to be the
best Friday of your lives.

555
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,159
Hey, what-what are we
doing in a boat?

556
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:56,786
- Summiting!
- Summiting!
- Summiting...!

557
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,874
- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yeah, you.

558
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:01,917
I take 3.

559
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:04,753
- It's from Jan.
- You can't look at my card.

560
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,797
I knew it was
going to be a girl.

561
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,883
I can't believe it.

562
00:33:09,925 --> 00:33:11,259
It's a girl!

563
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:14,346
- Yeah!
- That's great.

564
00:33:14,346 --> 00:33:15,847
Alright, good on you.

565
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:18,225
I know. I knew.
I knew she was.

566
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:20,936
- Thank you. Thank you, Doug.
- Cheers, mate.

567
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:22,604
When is she due?

568
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:24,189
Mid July.
As soon as I get back.

569
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:27,526
- You can't leave now, buddy.
- Yeah, that's true.

570
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,110
Hey, Rob.

571
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:30,529
Yeah?

572
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:32,405
Jan doesn't mind you being here?

573
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:35,992
Oh oh.
Krakauer's sword is unleashed.

574
00:33:36,034 --> 00:33:38,578
It's okay. I'm...
Jan's a climber, Jon. She gets it.

575
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,580
- Oh yeah?
- She is, Helen.

576
00:33:40,622 --> 00:33:41,998
Now you, Doug.
What about your wife?

577
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,043
Oh, she's been fine with it
ever since we divorced.

578
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,213
- She's been great with everything since then.
- I'm so sorry, buddy.

579
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:49,756
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:51,383
No no no.
I asked because

581
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:54,845
Peach said to me, "If you climb 1 more mountain,
I will divorce you."

582
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:56,596
And you went ahead
and then booked this trip.

583
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,515
- Oh.
- Ow...

584
00:33:58,515 --> 00:34:01,476
No no no. The worst-
The worst part of it is that, I...

585
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:04,312
I kind of forgot to tell her.

586
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:06,731
- No.
- Ha ha ha.

587
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:08,733
I forgot to tell her.
I did.

588
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:11,611
Alright.
It's all on the table here.

589
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:14,239
It hurts. It's dangerous.
It...

590
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:17,576
destroys relationships.
It's costing you all a small fortune.

591
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,202
- Were there any negative aspects?
- Yeah.

592
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:22,038
Come on, I got to ask the question.
You know I do.

593
00:34:22,372 --> 00:34:23,915
Why?

594
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,918
Why?

595
00:34:27,961 --> 00:34:28,712
Because

596
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:31,214
- Because it's there!
- It's there!
- It's there!

597
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:33,258
That's why.
Thank you Mr. Mallory.

598
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,844
Come on, guys,
I'm-I'm serious.

599
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,345
- Yasuko.
- Huh?

600
00:34:37,345 --> 00:34:39,472
Why are you climbing Everest?

601
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,141
Uh.

602
00:34:41,183 --> 00:34:43,435
I'm 47 years old.

603
00:34:43,435 --> 00:34:45,812
I have reached 6 of the 7 summits.

604
00:34:45,854 --> 00:34:50,650
So. Of course, now I have to
reach the 7th.

605
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:51,860
- It's not an answer.
- Oh.

606
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:53,778
Why...
No, why any summits?

607
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:56,281
- Well. I...
- Doug.

608
00:34:56,406 --> 00:34:57,908
Why?

609
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:00,619
- Come on. Tell him about the kids.
- What.

610
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,953
- Tell him about the kids.
- Yeah.

611
00:35:02,037 --> 00:35:05,248
- Oh. I...
- You have kids?

612
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah, I have kids.
But...

613
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:11,296
I thought I told you their's...
their elementary school back home...

614
00:35:11,296 --> 00:35:13,465
I've been going and talking
to the kids there and they

615
00:35:13,507 --> 00:35:16,718
actual helped me raised some
of the money to come and...

616
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,888
gave me a flag to plant
on the Summit and...

617
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:23,308
so, I was thinking maybe it's...

618
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:29,397
they see an...a regular guy can,
you know, follow impossible dreams.

619
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:33,777
Maybe they will be inspired to
do the same, I guess.

620
00:35:33,944 --> 00:35:39,991
I'm climbing Mount Everest
because I can.

621
00:35:40,534 --> 00:35:46,039
Because, to be able to climb that high and
see that kind of beauty nobody ever sees,

622
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:49,334
it'll be a crime not to.

623
00:35:50,752 --> 00:35:51,837
Yeh yeh, Dougy.

624
00:35:51,837 --> 00:35:54,172
- There you go.
- I like that.

625
00:35:59,261 --> 00:36:00,387
Hello.

626
00:36:00,428 --> 00:36:03,056
Hey.
Did I wake you?

627
00:36:03,348 --> 00:36:04,975
No.

628
00:36:05,183 --> 00:36:07,686
I did to, you liar.

629
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,816
- You okay?
- Yeah.

630
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:16,111
Yeah yeah, I'm good.
I'm better. I'm better now.

631
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:18,238
I missed you.

632
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:21,616
We go for the final ascend tomorrow.

633
00:36:21,616 --> 00:36:24,578
Oh. So, you're...
you summit on Friday?

634
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,538
Yeah.
10th.

635
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:30,375
- It's your lucky day.
- It is.

636
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,085
How's the weather?

637
00:36:32,544 --> 00:36:34,087
It's good.

638
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:36,298
Yeah, I think we're going to
get a good window.

639
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:40,468
- So... It's a girl.
- Oh yeah.

640
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,138
And, did you go to the doctor?
Did you get your scan done?

641
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,849
- Did you see her?
- Yes, we're good.

642
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:50,520
And?
Come on, what does she look like?

643
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh, you know.
Blonde hair, nice smile.

644
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:56,860
Perfect height-weight ratio,
she's going to be a great climber.

645
00:36:58,528 --> 00:37:02,365
She's here, Rob...
already.

646
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:05,243
- Wow.
- Me and you.

647
00:37:05,243 --> 00:37:07,496
And a little bear, huh.

648
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:10,373
And in one day,

649
00:37:10,373 --> 00:37:13,418
you,
me,

650
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,838
and our little Sarah, we'll all
go climbing together. Huh.

651
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,757
Sarah?

652
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:21,092
Yeah.
What do you think?

653
00:37:21,092 --> 00:37:23,220
- No way.
- Come on.

654
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,680
- No.
- Please, think about it.

655
00:37:25,722 --> 00:37:27,724
- No.
- Huh.

656
00:37:31,728 --> 00:37:35,273
- You're still there?
- Of course I'm still here.

657
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:39,653
I love you.

658
00:37:39,986 --> 00:37:41,947
I love you too.

659
00:37:46,284 --> 00:37:47,869
Sleep well, my love.

660
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:50,247
Alright.
Bye.

661

* Everest climbers
Puja blessing ceremony

662
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:41,590
- I need to take him down.
- Yeah.

663
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:43,758
You can't get Scott on the radio?

664
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,720
No.
No, I think he's-he's up ahead.

665
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:58,481
Best not to stay
too long at the Summit.

666
00:38:58,523 --> 00:39:00,609
It's a long way to go, man.

667
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:06,364
Head down,
one step at a time.

668
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:08,492
You got it, boss.

669
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:12,537
You seen Dale?

670
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:15,540
Yeah, and he wasn’t looking too good,
but...

671
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,752
Neal seem to have
handle the situation.

672
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,128
Try to use your radio.

673
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,506
- You kidding me.
- No.

674
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:25,217
Guess it's not working, huh.

675
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,594
I'm going down to Camp 1.

676
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:29,554
If he's not doing so well,
I'm going to take him down to Base Camp.

677
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:30,931
and I'll head back up.

678
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:33,808
- You guys alright?
- Yeah.

679
00:39:34,935 --> 00:39:36,811
He can't be too far
ahead of you, mate.

680
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:39,648
Yeah.
I'll make it down in half the time.

681
00:39:40,732 --> 00:39:43,735
I'm going to catch you.
Woo.

682
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:46,196
Woo.
I'll catch you.

683
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:49,366
Cheers, mate.

00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:03,797
- Rob to Guy. Are you there, mate?
(MOUNT PUMORI, 8 KM WEST OF EVEREST)

687
00:40:03,797 --> 00:40:06,466
- Guy to Rob. I'm here.
(MOUNT PUMORI, 8 KM WEST OF EVEREST)

688
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:10,053
Good to hear you, Guy.
Where are you?

689
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:12,222
Camp 1, Pumori.

690
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:14,140
Yeah.

691
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:16,935
There you go,

692
00:40:17,102 --> 00:40:20,021
Listen, I think you're on the
wrong mountain there.

693
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:22,315
Look, I can't talk and
we got to get out of here.

694
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:25,819
Alright, mate. Oh, listen.
You take care on the kiddy slope.

695
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:27,779
I ought to get back
to the real thing.

696
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:30,615
Hey, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.

697
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,127
Aye!
Watch out!

698
00:40:43,128 --> 00:40:44,296
Aw!

699
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,090
ROB!

700
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:49,301
- Rob!
- I got you.

701
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,313
Harold, you okay?

702
00:41:04,774 --> 00:41:06,401
Is everyone okay?

703
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:08,153
We're okay!

704
00:41:13,283 --> 00:41:15,035
Come here, come here, come here.
Sit. Sit down, sit.

705
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:16,745
I'm fine.

706
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:19,498
Look at me.

707
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:20,749
- Look at me!
- I'm fine, mate.

708
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:21,958
Look at me, Harold.

709
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,752
Look.
I'm tell you, I'm alright.

710
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:25,754
- Okay.
- I'm alright.

711
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:29,424
- Harold.
- Thank you.

712
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:31,510
Don't do that to me again, aye.

713
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:34,513
Rob, I'm sorry.

714
00:41:35,347 --> 00:41:36,681
Okay, mate.

715
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:39,726
I'll get drop back with Frank's,
you start with him, alright?

716
00:41:39,851 --> 00:41:42,103
- Alright.
- Alright.

717
00:41:43,855 --> 00:41:47,359
- Alright. Straight here.
(Camp 3 : 7,315 metres)

Let's get him on the oxygen.

719

Bravo to Scott Fischer.
Bravo to Scott Fischer.

Mountain Madness, have you copy?

721
00:41:52,823 --> 00:41:55,534
Hey, man.
Scott here.

722
00:41:55,534 --> 00:41:58,537
I've been down to Base Camp
and I'm back to Camp 1.

723
00:41:58,537 --> 00:41:59,871
I'll catch you tomorrow.

724
00:41:59,913 --> 00:42:02,624
What? You not going to
rest up a day first, huh?

725
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:07,712
Scott, you sound a little rough.
Hey, take an extra day.

726
00:42:07,712 --> 00:42:10,882
No way, Jose.
What, missing out on all the fun.

727
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:15,220
It's a lot of up and down in...
one day even for you, Scott.

728
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,639
You know what they say, man.

729
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:20,559
It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.

730
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,062
You sure you're going to be okay?

731
00:42:24,104 --> 00:42:25,397
- Scott?
- I'll be good.

732
00:42:25,397 --> 00:42:28,400
Just taking a shot of
dexamethasone now.

733
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,236
Just don't push yourself too hard.

734
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:33,405
Okay?
Over and out.

735
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:43,290
Rob, I've just been over the Miles
to get a weather update.

736
00:42:43,498 --> 00:42:48,086
It's moving fast.
It's changed course slightly

737
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:51,840
and it could still go north but
if it doesn't

738
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,261
It's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.

739
00:42:58,096 --> 00:43:00,557
Get some weather forecast, Helen.

740
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,767
The mountain makes it's own weather.

741
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:04,686
We're keeping an eye on it.

742
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:07,022
Yeah, sure.
Just, letting you know.

743
00:43:07,105 --> 00:43:08,773
Appreciate it, Helen.

744
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,154
Why're we doing this to ourselves?

745
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:19,951
Oh, it's crazy.

746
00:43:24,956 --> 00:43:27,125
You know I never told
Krakauer this.

747
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:29,878
When he was asking us
why we climb Everest.

748
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,630
When I'm at home...

749
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:35,800
I just got this big...

750
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:38,970
black cloud following me.

751
00:43:39,012 --> 00:43:41,139
You know, like a depression.

752
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:43,850
When I'm out here...

753
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,311
on a mountain,
any mountain,

754
00:43:48,438 --> 00:43:50,482
it's just like it's a cure.

755
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:54,152
Feel like I'm reborn.

756
00:43:54,611 --> 00:43:56,613
So, you're happy now?

757
00:43:58,114 --> 00:44:00,325
Now I'm starting to wonder.

758
00:44:02,994 --> 00:44:05,080
This is suffering, man.

759
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:08,542
This is suffering.

760
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:10,210
Yeah.

761
00:44:10,544 --> 00:44:13,046
Suffer a few more days.

762
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,008
The rest of your life, you'll be a guy
that climb to the top of Everest.

763
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:24,391
I just hope I get there.

764
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,018
Yeah.

765
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:30,564
Just hope I get there
and get home.

766
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,697
What do you think, Mike?

767
00:44:41,366 --> 00:44:45,162
Almost pretty good.
A little bit of wind up high.

768
00:44:45,537 --> 00:44:47,747
And if it picks up, we can
always come back down.

769
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:50,500
- Exactly.
- It's your call, Rob.

770
00:44:51,376 --> 00:44:53,211
Let's get them all going.

771
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:47,682
Camp 4 : 7,951 metres

772
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:49,434
Hey, Rob!

773
00:45:49,434 --> 00:45:52,771
- You, okay?
- Not good!

774
00:45:58,109 --> 00:46:01,112
I'm hoping it's going to
die down after sun down.

775
00:46:01,154 --> 00:46:02,989
Been doing that.

776
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:04,825
I don't like this.

777
00:46:04,866 --> 00:46:08,078
We don't go
if it doesn't calm.

778
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:12,207
- I talk to Scott when he come's here.
- Okay.

779
00:46:24,636 --> 00:46:25,846
Scott!

780
00:46:25,887 --> 00:46:28,890
- Scott!
- Anatoli, here.

781
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:42,112
Anatoli, where is Rob?

782
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:44,531
Where are they?
Did he go down?

783
00:46:44,948 --> 00:46:48,618
Where's Rob?
What's Rob's team doing?

784
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:52,247
Rob will see
if it passes.

785
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:54,833
If he wait.

786
00:46:57,377 --> 00:47:00,213
- We wait.
- Okay.

787
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:04,467
Friday, 10th May

788
00:47:13,685 --> 00:47:15,520
Hey, guys.

789
00:47:15,687 --> 00:47:17,814
Come out and take a look.

790
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:34,372
At least somebody up there loves us.

791
00:47:34,372 --> 00:47:36,041
Lovely.

792
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:41,379
Where did the storm go?

793
00:47:41,963 --> 00:47:43,715
Exactly.

794
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:48,053
- That's crazy.
- You ready to saddle up?

795
00:47:50,222 --> 00:47:52,390
Okay, everyone.

796
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:54,351
We got a window.

797
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,603
We don't know how long
it's going to last.

798
00:47:56,937 --> 00:47:58,897
But we're going to go for it.

799
00:47:59,064 --> 00:48:01,066
Be ready in half an hour.

800
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:03,568
We have a 2 PM turn around.
Let's climb this thing.

801
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:05,111
Okay.

802
00:48:09,157 --> 00:48:11,618
So, today's the day, huh?

803
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:13,453
Yeah.

804
00:48:14,913 --> 00:48:16,706
Now or never.

805
00:48:19,584 --> 00:48:21,503
Oh boy.

806
00:48:24,506 --> 00:48:27,092
The south Africans were
laid out at Camp 3.

807
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:29,427
They never made it into Camp 4.

808
00:48:29,427 --> 00:48:31,096
But we got caught up in it.

809
00:48:31,096 --> 00:48:35,392
- Maybe it blew though early.
- Yeah. Well, it hit us all night.

810
00:48:35,475 --> 00:48:38,270
But that was nothing,
absolutely nothing.

811
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,647
So, it's definitely worth a shot.

812
00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:43,775
I'll radio Ed,
tell him you're continuing.

813
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:46,444
Any messages?

814
00:48:46,444 --> 00:48:49,614
Yeah. Ring Jan, tell her that
we're heading out.

815
00:48:49,656 --> 00:48:52,951
I'll call you, Helen, in 12 hours
when we get to the Summit.

816
00:48:52,993 --> 00:48:54,953
Turn around is 2 PM.

817
00:48:54,995 --> 00:48:56,913
Good luck and
god speed to you all.

818
00:48:56,955 --> 00:48:58,790
Okay. Thank, Helen.
Bye bye.

819
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,125
I'll see you guys up there.

820
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,459
- Take it easy, Scott.
- Let's do it.

821
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:03,461
I'll get a couple of hours of sleep
and I'll be right behind you.

822
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:04,838
- Yeah, okay.
- See you at the top.

823
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:07,591
- Have fun, Pittman. Yeah.
- You get some rest, okay.

824
00:49:07,632 --> 00:49:08,758
See you there.

825
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,720
- You got the ropes for the Hillary Step?
- Yeah.

826
00:49:11,761 --> 00:49:13,096
- Okay.
- Okay.

827
00:49:13,096 --> 00:49:14,681
Okay.

828
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:27,694
The Balcony : 8,412 metres

829
00:49:27,736 --> 00:49:30,780
04:30 AM

830
00:49:31,364 --> 00:49:33,325
Can we go any faster?

831
00:49:33,325 --> 00:49:35,076
Not a chance we can
go faster here.

832
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:38,497
It's too difficult.
This could take a while.

833
00:49:39,456 --> 00:49:41,500
We're losing time.

834
00:49:56,181 --> 00:49:57,849
This might be it.

835
00:49:57,974 --> 00:49:59,434
I don't know.

836
00:49:59,809 --> 00:50:03,188
Okay.
Guys, go in front of us.

837
00:50:03,271 --> 00:50:05,982
- Alright, Beck, let's sit you down.
- Okay.

838
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:14,741
Beck.
Look at me.

839
00:50:16,576 --> 00:50:17,953
I need to send you down
with someone.

840
00:50:17,994 --> 00:50:19,704
- No. I don't want to go down, Rob.
- No, you got to go down.

841
00:50:19,704 --> 00:50:21,706
I don't want to go down.

842
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,878
Okay.

843
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:32,634
Alright, Beck.
Listen.

844
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:34,845
You can wait here for half and hour.
Beck, listen to me.

845
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:40,141
If it gets better by then,
join in the queue and keep going up.

846
00:50:40,183 --> 00:50:43,186
If it doesn't get better, Beck,
I'm sorry, mate. It's over.

847
00:50:43,228 --> 00:50:47,023
Sherpas are going to go and drop off the
extra oxygen on the south side while they can.

848
00:50:47,065 --> 00:50:50,235
I'm going to send one of them
down for you. Is that clear?

849
00:50:50,277 --> 00:50:52,529
- Yeah?
- Alright.

850
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:55,699
Okay, mate.
Alright.

851
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:00,829
God speed.

852
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:04,082
Sandy, do you want to go down?

853
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:06,710
What?
No, no way.

854
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:08,837
Look, Lopsang, I'm going
to make it to the top.

855
00:51:08,837 --> 00:51:10,922
- Do you understand?
- Okay.

856
00:51:10,922 --> 00:51:14,509
- I'm not going back, okay?
- Okay.

857
00:51:14,968 --> 00:51:18,388
The Southeast Ridge.

858
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,481
Hey, where are the ropes?

859
00:51:27,522 --> 00:51:30,025
There is no rope.
No rope.

860
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:31,902
Yeah?
They should have been fixed.

861
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:33,570
Do you have more in your pack.

862
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:36,198
Lopsang has the ropes.
He's not here.

863
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,618
- No ropes?
- No.

864
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:42,120
Alright.
Neal.

865
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,373
Guy to Rob.
Listen, we got a problem here, mate.

866
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:49,169
There's no fixed ropes on the
crevasse to Hillary Step, over.

867
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:50,754
Where is Ang dorjee and Lopsang?

868
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:54,007
Yeah, I got Ang Dorjee here
but there's not sign of Lopsang.

869
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:58,094
So, me, Neal, Anatoli are going
to set some new ones, over.

870
00:51:58,136 --> 00:51:59,304
- Fine then.
- Yeah.

871
00:51:59,304 --> 00:52:01,932
- Good.
- Let's do it.

872
00:52:06,102 --> 00:52:09,564
- What's going on?
- No fixed rope.

873
00:52:09,564 --> 00:52:11,233
What?

874
00:52:40,178 --> 00:52:41,638
That's it.

875
00:52:41,638 --> 00:52:44,015
1 step at a time, Doug.

876
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:54,401
Come on, Dougy.
Deep breaths, Dougy.

877
00:52:54,442 --> 00:52:56,361
- I can't, man.
- Keep it on. Keep it on.

878
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:58,446
- Rob.
- Deep breaths, Dougy. Yeah.

879
00:52:58,488 --> 00:52:59,990
Hang on.

880
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,875
You can do this , Dougy.

881
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:12,669
- I know you can, pal.
- Yeah?

882
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:16,548
I don't want to see you
back here the third time, mate.

883
00:53:33,398 --> 00:53:36,735
John.
You heading back down?

884
00:53:37,402 --> 00:53:41,114
There's a hold up. There's no fixed ropes
above the South Summit.

885
00:53:41,114 --> 00:53:42,574
Yeah.
I know, mate.

886
00:53:42,616 --> 00:53:44,576
But we are sorting that
situation out now.

887
00:53:44,576 --> 00:53:46,912
Ran out of juice waiting.

888
00:53:46,912 --> 00:53:49,456
God.
I'm sorry, Rob.

889
00:53:49,498 --> 00:53:51,500
It's your call, pal.

890
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:56,963
I don't want to run out
of oxygen up there.

891
00:53:57,506 --> 00:53:59,257
Sorry, Rob.

892
00:54:05,764 --> 00:54:07,349
We've a little bit of a set back.

893
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,560
Lou, Stuart and John Taske
just turned back, just...

894
00:54:10,602 --> 00:54:12,604
just below the South Summit.

895
00:54:12,604 --> 00:54:15,774
- How are the conditions so far?
- Cold and windy.

896
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:19,736
- Okay, let me know, Rob.
- Okay, Helen. Thanks, bye bye.

897
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:25,158
I hope we're not looking at another year
with no clients at the top.

898
00:54:25,534 --> 00:54:27,619
Well, if that ain't going to
move them pretty soon.

899
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:29,788
They're out of time, aren't they?

900
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:31,790
Yeah.
And...

901
00:54:32,123 --> 00:54:35,252
What's Jon going to say
about that in his article.

902
00:54:36,294 --> 00:54:37,420
- It's Rob.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

903
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:38,505
- Guy.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

904
00:54:38,547 --> 00:54:40,841
- We just lost Lou, Stuart and John Taske.
(The Hillary Step : 8,760 metres)

905
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:43,009
What's going on?
What's the hold up?

906
00:54:43,051 --> 00:54:44,678
Yeah, yeah, mate.
We...

907
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:48,932
We sent Anatoli and Neal
to the top of the Step

908
00:54:48,974 --> 00:54:51,059
fixing the ropes.

909
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:54,938
We're at the-
at the Face's Step, over.

910
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:59,151
- So, how's Doug doing?
- Doug's just behind me.

911
00:54:59,151 --> 00:55:01,444
I left him behind
to scoot forward.

912
00:55:01,486 --> 00:55:03,363
Yeah, I got eyes on you right now.
Yep, that's me.

913
00:55:03,405 --> 00:55:05,240
Let's move this

914
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,701
as quickly as possible, over.

915
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:11,288
We'll start moving everybody up
as soon as we get the all clear.

916
00:55:12,289 --> 00:55:14,958
Rob to base. Rob to base, Hel.
Copy, Helen.

917
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:17,127
- You alright?
- Copy. Base camp to Rob.

918
00:55:17,169 --> 00:55:21,798
Have you... Have you heard from Scott?
Anyone manage to find out where he is, over.

919
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:24,843
Woo-Eee!
Yo, dude.

920
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:28,138
Look. Where are you, mate? We got a
real logjam here at the Hillary Step, over.

921
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,515
- I'm more than an hour behind.
- Just chill.

922
00:55:30,515 --> 00:55:33,268
Everybody is just sitting there
using up their oxygen.

923
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,353
Get here as soon as you can.

924
00:55:37,355 --> 00:55:39,357
- Oh my god. You okay, Beck?
- Yeah.

925
00:55:39,357 --> 00:55:43,487
Oh I got a little problem with my eyes.
You guys turning back?

926
00:55:43,528 --> 00:55:45,906
There's a logjam below
the Hillary Step.

927
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:48,950
It's crazy.
Come down with us.

928
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:52,162
No, I can't.
Promise Rob I'd wait for him.

929
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,538
- Your call.
- I'm good.

930
00:55:53,538 --> 00:55:55,165
See you down there.

931
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:58,543
Neal.
Andy.

932
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:00,754
Okay, Anatoli.

933
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:02,380
I'm done.

934
00:56:03,381 --> 00:56:06,968
Safe to climb.

935
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,386
Okay, we're climbing up.

936
00:56:08,386 --> 00:56:09,638
- Hey, Mike.
- What?

937
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:11,556
- You mind if I go first?
- Why.

938
00:56:11,556 --> 00:56:13,767
I'm running pretty low on "O".

939
00:56:14,893 --> 00:56:17,062
Rob, it's Mike here.

940
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:19,606
Eh. We have been all clear
on this end.

941
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,735
I'm going to stay here with Yasuko
till we got a clear line.

942
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:27,364
I'll be here till I get a visual
on Doug. Over and out

943
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,671
* 01:14 PM *

944
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:26,631
We did it.

945
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:46,443
Hey.

946
00:58:04,503 --> 00:58:06,546
Thank you very much.

947
00:58:06,588 --> 00:58:08,798
Thank you, Mom.

948
00:58:20,644 --> 00:58:22,479
Yasuko.

949
00:58:24,648 --> 00:58:26,024
- Seven.
- Seven.

950
00:58:26,024 --> 00:58:28,610
- 7 summits.
- 7 summits.

951
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,903
Come here.

952
00:58:29,945 --> 00:58:34,407
I'm so proud of you, Yasuko.
So proud.

953
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:36,201
Thank you.

954
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:41,081
Thank you.
Thank you.

955
00:58:41,706 --> 00:58:44,042
Rob to base.
Rob to base.

956
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:49,214
Rob, this is Helen.
Hello, where are you?

957
00:58:49,256 --> 00:58:51,716
I'm at the top of Everest, Helen.
We made it.

958
00:58:51,716 --> 00:58:53,051
- Yeah.
- They did it.

959
00:58:53,093 --> 00:58:54,553
Copy us, over.

960
00:58:54,553 --> 00:58:59,391
Oh, we copy you loud and clear, Rob.
It's wonderful to hear your voice up there.

961
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:00,725
Who are you with again, Rob?

962
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:02,894
At the moment
I'm with Mike and Yasuko.

963
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:04,479
Good job, man.

964
00:59:04,521 --> 00:59:06,398
Rob, see you.
Thank you.

965
00:59:06,398 --> 00:59:09,151
Jon and Kasischke have
already been and gone.

966
00:59:09,192 --> 00:59:11,069
Doug is just coming over the horizon.

967
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:13,113
And-And what about Beck?

968
00:59:13,155 --> 00:59:15,824
Beck was having a problem
with his eye sight.

969
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:20,078
He waited on the Southeast Ridge,
on the Balcony.

970
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,289
But the first three
never came back, over.

971
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:25,458
And I... I guess you'll be
leaving right away, yes?

972
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,086
Moving off in a few minutes
just as soon I see Doug,

973
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:29,921
we'll be heading back down, over.

974
00:59:29,921 --> 00:59:32,924
Alright, understood.
Oh, that's terrific, Rob.

975
00:59:32,924 --> 00:59:35,218
We're all keeping
our fingers cross for Doug.

976
00:59:35,218 --> 00:59:37,220
Over and out, Helen.

977
00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:51,318
- Congratulation.
- You're welcome.

978
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,279
Yeah, ladsy.
You did it.

979
01:00:27,979 --> 01:00:29,981
You look terrible.

980
01:00:30,607 --> 01:00:34,319
My stories,
not so good, man.

981
01:00:34,653 --> 01:00:37,906
- You see Doug?
- Oh, yeah. He's way way...

982
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:40,784
way back there, man.

983
01:00:40,826 --> 01:00:43,995
Hey, Roberto.
Where're the rest of your guys.

984
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:47,541
'Cause I'm pretty sure
my whole team

985
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:48,875
made it up, yeah.

986
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:50,710
Heh heh heh.
I saw them.

987
01:00:50,752 --> 01:00:52,921
Don't worry.
I won't tell Krakauer.

988
01:00:52,963 --> 01:00:55,507
Hold on, mate.
I know it's bad, heh.

989
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:57,592
I'll give you it this year.

990
01:00:57,634 --> 01:00:59,970
Scott, you really
don't look too good.

991
01:01:00,011 --> 01:01:01,388
- Lopsang.
- Yeah.

992
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:03,640
Come, mate.
Let's get him down.

993
01:01:10,397 --> 01:01:11,731
Alright.

994
01:01:12,107 --> 01:01:13,608
Let's go.

995
01:01:37,716 --> 01:01:40,927
Harold.
What're you doing?

996
01:01:41,261 --> 01:01:43,513
I'm just trying to
sort out the "O".

997
01:01:43,555 --> 01:01:46,016
I can't find any full ones.

998
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:47,893
There's full bottles,
I saw them on the way up.

999
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:48,977
No.

1000
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:50,770
So I pretty sure you
just running out of luck.

1001
01:01:50,812 --> 01:01:54,065
- No. They just have, they're not full.
- Harold. Listen, I saw...

1002
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:57,152
Look, Mike.
I've checked twice, alright.

1003
01:01:57,444 --> 01:02:00,780
Yeah.
Alright, man.

1004
01:02:01,573 --> 01:02:03,408
I'm going down.

1005
01:02:04,868 --> 01:02:06,411
Yeah.

1006
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:13,585
03:15 PM

1007
01:02:14,586 --> 01:02:16,421
Doug. Doug.
Doug.

1008
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:19,174
- It's over, mate.
- No.

1009
01:02:19,216 --> 01:02:21,092
I' sorry.
No no no no.

1010
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:23,470
Doug.
You're too late, okay.

1011
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,806
You guys keep going, mate,
I'll catch up.

1012
01:02:26,848 --> 01:02:28,600
Doug. Doug.
Doug, listen to me.

1013
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,393
- It's way too long, it's over.
- No, it's not.

1014
01:02:30,435 --> 01:02:33,230
Now, listen to me, mate.
I'm sorry.

1015
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,524
But I got to turn you around.

1016
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:37,067
Okay.

1017
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:39,611
I can do it.

1018
01:02:40,779 --> 01:02:44,282
It's right here, man.
It's right here.

1019
01:02:44,866 --> 01:02:48,161
I'm not coming back next year, man.
It's my last chance.

1020
01:02:51,665 --> 01:02:54,042
You got to let me do this.

1021
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:57,337
Let me do this.

1022
01:02:57,796 --> 01:02:59,506
- Okay.
- Please, Rob.

1023
01:02:59,506 --> 01:03:02,425
- Let's do it. Let's get it done.
- Yeah.

1024
01:03:02,425 --> 01:03:04,761
- Come on.
- Okay.

1025
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,350
Alright, then.

1026
01:03:42,841 --> 01:03:44,426
- Beck?
- What?

1027
01:03:44,467 --> 01:03:47,596
- Are you okay?
- Who is there?

1028
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:50,891
- It's Jon.
- I'm not seeing too well, Jon.

1029
01:03:50,932 --> 01:03:52,893
Fre-Freezing.

1030
01:03:53,852 --> 01:03:55,854
Mike's just behind me.

1031
01:03:55,854 --> 01:03:57,814
He's back there with Yasuko.

1032
01:03:57,856 --> 01:04:01,109
You'll be okay.
Mike's right behind me.

1033
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:02,903
You okay?

1034
01:04:02,944 --> 01:04:04,738
I'll see you then.

1035
01:04:10,368 --> 01:04:12,245
There she is.

1036
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,289
Almost there, mate.

1037
01:04:15,749 --> 01:04:18,043
Dig deep, Doug.
Dig deep.

1038
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:19,711
There you go.

1039
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:32,891
There you go.

1040
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:36,645
Yehhhh!

1041
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:41,233
Huh, you made it.

1042
01:04:46,363 --> 01:04:48,073
You did it.
Huh.

1043
01:04:48,073 --> 01:04:50,909
Yeah.
Because of you, man.

1044
01:05:00,085 --> 01:05:02,629
Guy to Rob.
You read me, mate?

1045
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,300
Guy to Rob.
Are you there?

1046
01:05:09,803 --> 01:05:11,763
This is going to the kids.

1047
01:05:13,098 --> 01:05:15,433
Yehhh!

1048
01:05:18,478 --> 01:05:20,230
Hang in there, Doug.

1049
01:05:20,355 --> 01:05:21,898
Come on.

1050
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:23,984
Easy.
Here, I got it.

1051
01:05:24,025 --> 01:05:26,486
Here.
I'm okay.

1052
01:05:26,611 --> 01:05:28,280
Yeah, I got it.

1053
01:05:31,116 --> 01:05:32,826
- Come on, let's get you up.
- I need...

1054
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:34,119
- Huh?
- Need more "O".

1055
01:05:34,161 --> 01:05:35,453
No, Doug.
We can't give you more "O".

1056
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:37,956
We got to get down
to the South Summit, come on.

1057
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,464
Guy going to Everest Base Camp.
Are you there, Helen?

1058
01:05:46,673 --> 01:05:48,800
Guy, this is Helen.
How is it going?

1059
01:05:48,842 --> 01:05:50,260
Yeah, I'm fine.

1060
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,262
I got a clear view of the Summit
and...

1061
01:05:52,304 --> 01:05:55,599
you know, we still got climbers up there.
They are not any of ours, right?

1062
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,018
We got 3 up and
they're all on their way down.

1063
01:05:58,059 --> 01:05:59,728
Well.
What are they doing there so late?

1064
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:03,023
And there's 2 o'clock turn around time,
they're way past it.

1065
01:06:03,064 --> 01:06:06,067
Here we go. Cloud coming out
of the valley. It's a lot of it.

1066
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:08,528
Thanks.
I'm calling them now, Guy.

1067
01:06:12,157 --> 01:06:14,326
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1068
01:06:16,328 --> 01:06:18,747
Rob, come in.
This is Helen.

1069
01:06:25,545 --> 01:06:26,838
Whoa!

1070
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:30,842
Easy. Easy. Easy, Dougy.
There you go. There you go.

1071
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,137
We're going to go
around the corner.

1072
01:06:35,472 --> 01:06:37,015
That's it.

1073
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:41,520
Rob, is that you?

1074
01:06:42,437 --> 01:06:43,814
Beck.

1075
01:06:44,272 --> 01:06:45,649
It's Mike, mate.

1076
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:48,401
- What're you doing here?
- I can't see, it's bad.

1077
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:49,945
You guys alright?

1078
01:06:49,945 --> 01:06:51,488
We got a problem with Beck.

1079
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:53,448
Hey, Mike.
We're getting low on "O".

1080
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,033
We got to move.

1081
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:56,660
I'll get you to stand up, okay.

1082
01:06:56,701 --> 01:06:58,495
I'll take the...

1083
01:07:00,497 --> 01:07:04,084
Has anyone got eyes
on Ang Dorjee?

1084
01:07:04,668 --> 01:07:08,088
Mate, I have just had Ang Dorjee
go past me heading down, over.

1085
01:07:08,088 --> 01:07:09,840
He's going down.

1086
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,383
Can you stop him?
Can you turn him around?

1087
01:07:11,383 --> 01:07:13,176
I need someone
to come back up now.

1088
01:07:13,218 --> 01:07:16,096
Hey!
Ang Dorjee.

1089
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,224
Ang Dorjee!

1090
01:07:19,224 --> 01:07:21,226
Base camp, do you copy, over.

1091
01:07:21,226 --> 01:07:23,311
Helen to Rob.
Go ahead.

1092
01:07:23,353 --> 01:07:24,729
Helen, please.

1093
01:07:24,729 --> 01:07:28,066
I need a bottle of gas
at the top of the Hillary Step.

1094
01:07:28,108 --> 01:07:30,068
I can't get him down without it.

1095
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,237
I'm really stuck.

1096
01:07:32,863 --> 01:07:33,989
Understood.

1097
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:37,868
That you need a bottle of oxygen
at the bottom of the Hillary Step.

1098
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:40,287
We're sending it up to you
as soon as we can.

1099
01:07:40,328 --> 01:07:43,582
At the top.
At the top.

1100
01:07:43,707 --> 01:07:46,042
The last thing I said to
Ang Dorjee was please

1101
01:07:46,084 --> 01:07:48,670
bring 2 bottles of gas
at the South Summit.

1102
01:07:48,712 --> 01:07:52,048
Yes, uh.
Copy that, Rob.

1103
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:56,052
Boys. There's oxygen
at the South Summit, right?

1104
01:07:56,094 --> 01:07:58,763
No. No.
This is Harold.

1105
01:07:58,805 --> 01:08:03,268
There's no oxygen
at South Summit.

1106
01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:05,645
Repeat.
No "O".

1107
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,566
Ang Dorjee stashed
4 bottles there, Harold.

1108
01:08:09,608 --> 01:08:11,610
Harold, where are you?

1109
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,114
Can you hear me, Harold?

1110
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,782
Harold.

1111
01:08:17,866 --> 01:08:19,784
Harold, can you hear me?

1112
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:24,247
Figure it'll take me about half an hour
to get back up to the South Summit.

1113
01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:28,919
Okay.

1114
01:08:29,127 --> 01:08:30,754
I'm coming.

1115
01:08:32,172 --> 01:08:33,465
If you don't have oxygen, mate,

1116
01:08:33,507 --> 01:08:35,425
don't come up, don't come up.
We're moving on.

1117
01:08:35,467 --> 01:08:37,469
I'm coming up to you, Rob.

1118
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:41,515
Doug, come on, mate.
Come on!

1119
01:08:45,519 --> 01:08:49,397
Rob, this is Base Camp.
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1120
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:52,108
I copy you, Carol.

1121
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:54,778
Rob, can you get yourself down?

1122
01:08:56,154 --> 01:08:58,490
Carol, we're not at that point yet.

1123
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:01,326
Rob, can you let us know
who you're with?

1124
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:03,995
I'm with Doug.

1125
01:09:04,037 --> 01:09:05,539
We're both listening.

1126
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:08,333
Come on, Dougy. Come on, mate.
One more alping, come on.

1127
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:10,710
Rob.
What is Doug's state of consciousness?

1128
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,546
He's really weak.

1129
01:09:12,546 --> 01:09:15,632
He collapsed after he
ran out of oxygen.

1130
01:09:15,882 --> 01:09:20,303
Okay.
Give him 8 mg of dexamethasone.

1131
01:09:20,428 --> 01:09:22,848
That's 2 tablets, Rob.

1132
01:09:23,223 --> 01:09:24,850
Guy to Rob.

1133
01:09:25,267 --> 01:09:27,144
Go ahead Guy.
I got you, mate.

1134
01:09:27,185 --> 01:09:29,688
Rob, I suggest
you get yourself down.

1135
01:09:29,688 --> 01:09:31,356
You know you're doing
no good up there.

1136
01:09:31,356 --> 01:09:33,066
And we got people we can
send up there to help Doug,

1137
01:09:33,108 --> 01:09:36,361
but you got to get
yourself down, you understand?

1138
01:09:36,403 --> 01:09:39,072
I mean, come on, mate.
We're playing with a man's life here.

1139
01:09:39,072 --> 01:09:41,867
There's no way I'm leaving Doug,
bellowing.

1140
01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:45,620
We got to keep moving, mate.

1141
01:09:45,662 --> 01:09:48,373
We got to keep moving,
we are in some trouble.

1142
01:09:48,373 --> 01:09:52,043
Yeah, Helen gonna... need some help.
So I'm gonna try make my way back.

1143
01:09:52,043 --> 01:09:53,420
- Okay?
- Okay.

1144
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,755
Alright.
Go on.

1145
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:07,559
Hey, Scott.
Scott.

1146
01:10:07,559 --> 01:10:09,227
You okay?

1147
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,941
Lopsang.

1148
01:10:15,192 --> 01:10:16,985
Lopsang.

1149
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:20,739
I'm done, pal.

1150
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:23,783
I'm done.

1151
01:10:25,327 --> 01:10:28,914
You go...
send Anatoli.

1152
01:10:29,498 --> 01:10:32,584
Send Anatoli back with some more.

1153
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:35,504
- Okay.
- Go.

1154
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:37,088
Okay.

1155
01:10:37,464 --> 01:10:40,842
I will send back, Anatoli.

1156
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:48,433
- Let's go.
- You go down.

1157
01:10:48,433 --> 01:10:50,143
No, mate.

1158
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:51,770
No. I'm not leaving
you behind, Doug.

1159
01:10:51,812 --> 01:10:53,438
- Come on.
- Got to rest.

1160
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,357
No, Doug! Come on!
Come on with me!

1161
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:58,193
I need 10 good minutes, Doug.
Come on.

1162
01:11:01,947 --> 01:11:03,907
Please, let me go.

1163
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:07,244
Damn it.
We're at the bottom of the Step.

1164
01:11:07,452 --> 01:11:10,997
On this leg.
This leg, Dougy, come on.

1165
01:11:11,456 --> 01:11:13,083
Come on.

1166
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:15,210
Here we go.

1167
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:36,231
Oh no.

1168
01:11:36,648 --> 01:11:38,108
Oh no.

1169
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:40,861
Hey. Hold it down.
Hold that down.

1170
01:11:40,902 --> 01:11:43,822
Come on, come on.
Get the chairs.

1171
01:12:24,696 --> 01:12:26,448
Come on, Dougy!

1172
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:29,034
Go, let's go!
Hurry up!

1173
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:08,281
Doug. I'm going to go to
the South Summit to get oxygen.

1174
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:11,201
Okay.
Got to find oxygen.

1175
01:13:11,243 --> 01:13:13,829
But, you got to stay here!

1176
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:18,124
Okay, stay here!
Don't move, I'll be back!

1177
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:44,442
Hey, Rob.

1178
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:25,609
Hey!
Stop!

1179
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:28,028
That's the wrong way!

1180
01:14:29,988 --> 01:14:32,115
Turn back!

1181
01:14:48,673 --> 01:14:50,300
Easy.

1182
01:15:05,524 --> 01:15:07,192
Hey, Rob.

1183
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:09,694
Hey, Rob!

1184
01:15:20,956 --> 01:15:22,707
Rob!

1185
01:15:24,042 --> 01:15:25,460
- I got...
- Harold?

1186
01:15:25,502 --> 01:15:27,629
I got oxygen.

1187
01:15:27,629 --> 01:15:32,133
Here.
I found some half empty ones.

1188
01:15:32,884 --> 01:15:35,178
Where's Doug?

1189
01:15:36,054 --> 01:15:38,265
Doug's gone.

1190
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,642
What?

1191
01:15:41,184 --> 01:15:43,061
Gone.

1192
01:15:56,491 --> 01:15:58,243
Come on!

1193
01:16:00,078 --> 01:16:01,663
Camp 4 is that way.

1194
01:16:01,705 --> 01:16:05,250
Get up!
Let's go.

1195
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:09,254
Come on.
Beck.

1196
01:16:17,053 --> 01:16:19,723
I'll get help!

1197
01:16:54,508 --> 01:16:56,551
Hey!

1198
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:58,845
Yeah!

1199
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:02,641
Neal!

1200
01:17:04,309 --> 01:17:06,144
- Anatoli.
- Where-Where are they?

1201
01:17:06,144 --> 01:17:08,355
They're still out there.

1202
01:17:14,778 --> 01:17:17,697
Jon!
I need help!

1203
01:17:17,823 --> 01:17:18,949
What?

1204
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,535
Get out there!
I need help!

1205
01:17:21,576 --> 01:17:23,995
I can't.
I can't see, Anatoli.

1206
01:17:23,995 --> 01:17:25,914
I'm snow blind.

1207
01:17:26,498 --> 01:17:29,459
Beck.
Doug.

1208
01:17:29,459 --> 01:17:32,754
They need help.
They're still out there.

1209
01:17:34,714 --> 01:17:38,677
I go find them.
You stay here.

1210
01:17:43,181 --> 01:17:45,350
12:00 AM

1211
01:17:52,816 --> 01:17:54,526
Good job.

1212
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:10,083
Hey!

1213
01:18:13,879 --> 01:18:15,714
Anatoli!

1214
01:18:21,511 --> 01:18:24,598
- Can you walk?
- I can't.

1215
01:18:25,974 --> 01:18:28,477
I'll come back.

1216
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,812
I'll stay!

1217
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:38,236
Give me that, come on.

1218
01:18:38,236 --> 01:18:41,406
- It won't budge. It's frozen!
- Take this.

1219
01:18:42,699 --> 01:18:44,409
The gloves.

1220
01:18:45,452 --> 01:18:47,454
I'm sorry.

1221
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:00,926
Come on, mate.

1222
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,428
Come on now.

1223
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:07,641
Thanks for coming back.

1224
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:31,456
- Hello, Base Camp.
- Helen, it's Jan.

1225
01:19:31,498 --> 01:19:34,584
Why haven't I heard from you?
Why hasn't anybody call me?

1226
01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:38,713
They've been hit by a storm, Jan.
It's really bad.

1227
01:19:39,881 --> 01:19:43,677
- Where is he?
- We don't know exactly. But...

1228
01:19:43,718 --> 01:19:45,637
He was still on the Summit at 4:00.

1229
01:19:45,637 --> 01:19:48,932
Oh my.
Can he get down?

1230
01:19:48,974 --> 01:19:51,935
Rob can,
but Doug can't.

1231
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:55,355
There's at least 13 people
stranded up there and...

1232
01:19:55,397 --> 01:19:57,983
while the storm is getting worse.

1233
01:20:01,444 --> 01:20:02,487
Helen!

1234
01:20:02,487 --> 01:20:06,199
Get Ang Dorjee up there.
He'll bring them down.

1235
01:20:06,491 --> 01:20:08,618
- Helen, do you understand?
- Helen. Give me an update.

1236
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:11,663
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

1237
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:13,582
Jan, yep.
We will get him.

1238
01:20:13,623 --> 01:20:16,543
And I will call you
the minute I hear from him.

1239
01:20:16,585 --> 01:20:18,712
- As soon as I hear from him.
- Thanks, Helen.

1240
01:20:18,753 --> 01:20:20,797
- Alright.
- Okay.

1241
01:20:20,797 --> 01:20:22,716
- Where is he?
- Guy, I haven't heard from him.

1242
01:20:22,716 --> 01:20:25,510
- Okay, I get it.
- I've been trying.

1243
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:27,512
- Guy.
- Just hang on, hang on.

1244
01:20:27,512 --> 01:20:29,639
Rob, it's Guy.
Where are you?

1245
01:20:29,681 --> 01:20:32,726
- Guy, I've been doing that for the last 2 hours.
- Alright. Alright.

1246
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:34,311
Rob, it's Guy.

1247
01:20:34,352 --> 01:20:37,063
- Just keep your energy, mate.
- Helen.

1248
01:20:37,105 --> 01:20:39,316
Once you catch a break, you move.
You know the drill.

1249
01:20:39,357 --> 01:20:42,986
Hey, Guy. We got a stash of oxygen
on the South Col.

1250
01:20:43,028 --> 01:20:45,197
- Whoever needs it can have it.
- That's the way, thank you.

1251
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:47,824
Faust's team are gonna go up,
they got a man to search,

1252
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:49,284
as soon as they can.

1253
01:20:49,326 --> 01:20:52,370
Anyone who is going would have
to leave at dawn.

1254
01:20:53,038 --> 01:20:54,206
That's right, David.

1255
01:20:54,206 --> 01:20:56,416
Go and let Ed knows what's going on,
I'll be right behind you.

1256
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,918
Camp 4, come in.

1257
01:20:57,959 --> 01:21:00,253
Hey, Rob.  Rob, can you hear me?
( 03:00 AM )

1258
01:21:00,295 --> 01:21:06,176
David Breashears has a stash of oxygen
at the South Col that we can use.

1259
01:21:06,176 --> 01:21:09,721
Alright, mate. Well, we're all organizing
a team, we're coming to get you.

1260
01:21:32,285 --> 01:21:34,246
Burning up.

1261
01:21:54,349 --> 01:21:56,101
No.
No.

1262
01:21:57,185 --> 01:21:58,812
Yasuko.

1263
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:01,815
Ohhh.

1264
01:22:01,857 --> 01:22:03,692
Andy

1265
01:22:10,282 --> 01:22:12,033
Come on!

1266
01:23:07,047 --> 01:23:10,634
Rob, talk to me, please. Pick up.
( Saturday, 11th May )

1267
01:23:14,513 --> 01:23:17,724
- Pick up, mate. Please
( 05:00 AM )

1268
01:23:44,876 --> 01:23:46,795
Was there any word from the others?

1269
01:23:46,837 --> 01:23:51,550
Anatoli managed to get 3 climbers back
from the South Col last night. But...

1270
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:54,219
Beck and Yasuko
are still out there.

1271
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:58,473
They try another search but everyone
who's been up there is exhausted.

1272
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:02,894
- Base.
- Rob, is that you?

1273
01:24:03,728 --> 01:24:06,731
Rob, where are you?
We're sending people for you.

1274
01:24:07,774 --> 01:24:09,860
Rob, this is Base Camp.

1275
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:18,743
Can't move anymore.
Can't move anymore

1276
01:24:19,661 --> 01:24:21,496
Hey, mate. Yeah, I know.
I know, mate. I know.

1277
01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:23,582
You got to keep on moving.

1278
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:25,500
Hands...

1279
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,920
Can't feel my hands,
they're frozen.

1280
01:24:31,339 --> 01:24:33,925
There's "D" ice on the ice.

1281
01:24:33,925 --> 01:24:36,470
I got "D" ice in my mask.

1282
01:24:36,511 --> 01:24:39,097
That's good. You got to get
that mask working. You got to.

1283
01:24:39,097 --> 01:24:40,599
The sun's going to come up
and...

1284
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,934
you know you can get warmer
and you can get moving.

1285
01:24:42,976 --> 01:24:45,020
- Guy.
- Yeah.

1286
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,354
Guy.

1287
01:24:46,396 --> 01:24:49,065
Harold was here.
Where did he go?

1288
01:24:49,107 --> 01:24:51,651
Rob.
Is Doug with you?

1289
01:24:55,071 --> 01:24:58,241
Doug.
Doug's gone.

1290
01:25:00,118 --> 01:25:02,287
Harold is gone.

1291
01:25:05,248 --> 01:25:07,876
Harold needed a little help.

1292
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,004
Okay.
Rob, you got to get yourself down.

1293
01:25:11,046 --> 01:25:12,714
Where are you?

1294
01:25:17,677 --> 01:25:19,429
Guy.

1295
01:25:19,471 --> 01:25:21,890
I'm in the...
in the little...

1296
01:25:21,932 --> 01:25:25,143
in the little deep just below
the South Summit.

1297
01:25:25,393 --> 01:25:26,978
Alright, you can do this.

1298
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:29,356
You just go to, you know,
pull yourself out of that deep,

1299
01:25:29,397 --> 01:25:31,608
and slide the rest of the way.

1300
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:33,735
Guy, send them boys.

1301
01:25:33,735 --> 01:25:37,697
Okay.
I'm going to need a little help.

1302
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:40,867
I got some Sheapas coming
up there with 3 oxygen.

1303
01:25:40,909 --> 01:25:42,661
You just got to
come on down, mate.

1304
01:25:42,661 --> 01:25:44,746
Aye, come on down.

1305
01:25:46,498 --> 01:25:47,999
Rob.

1306
01:25:52,712 --> 01:25:54,881
Can you patch Jan through?

1307
01:25:54,923 --> 01:25:57,592
- To what?
- Pat-Patch her through.

1308
01:25:57,592 --> 01:25:59,427
Let's-Let's just try it.
Let's just...

1309
01:25:59,469 --> 01:26:02,889
put the satphone next to the radio
and uh.

1310
01:26:02,931 --> 01:26:06,101
If anyone can motivate him
to move, then Jan will.

1311
01:26:07,352 --> 01:26:08,895
Guy to Rob.

1312
01:26:09,187 --> 01:26:10,772
Guy to Rob.

1313
01:26:13,441 --> 01:26:16,153
Guy to Rob.
Can you read me?

1314
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:23,994
- Rob, are you there?
- We're getting him now.

1315
01:26:26,246 --> 01:26:28,165
Rob, this is Helen.

1316
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,710
Copy.

1317
01:26:31,877 --> 01:26:35,046
Rob, I got Jan for you.

1318
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:38,300
My Jan?

1319
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,634
Yeah. She's just here.

1320
01:26:39,676 --> 01:26:42,095
- Jan, you're on.
- Okay.

1321
01:26:42,804 --> 01:26:45,265
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you doing?

1322
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,645
Hi, my love.

1323
01:26:50,687 --> 01:26:51,813
I'm a bit

1324
01:26:51,855 --> 01:26:53,982
a bit cold.

1325
01:26:54,232 --> 01:26:56,151
My love, I'm okay.

1326
01:26:56,193 --> 01:26:58,028
I know you are.

1327
01:26:58,069 --> 01:27:00,697
But the sun will warm you soon.

1328
01:27:01,072 --> 01:27:05,076
Sweetheart.
You got to get moving.

1329
01:27:05,243 --> 01:27:07,621
You got to come on down.

1330
01:27:08,455 --> 01:27:10,582
My hands...

1331
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:14,753
frozen.

1332
01:27:16,046 --> 01:27:17,172
My...

1333
01:27:17,672 --> 01:27:20,300
My feet are frozen.

1334
01:27:20,717 --> 01:27:24,471
We're sending people up to you
with tea and "O"s

1335
01:27:24,513 --> 01:27:27,766
But, you got to get moving, Rob.
Can you hear me?

1336
01:27:27,808 --> 01:27:30,393
You got to get
your circulation going.

1337
01:27:30,435 --> 01:27:32,521
Okay, my love.

1338
01:27:32,687 --> 01:27:36,107
You do it.
Do it right now!

1339
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:40,195
I love you.

1340
01:27:41,029 --> 01:27:43,114
Over and out.

1341
01:27:52,707 --> 01:27:54,501
Come on, Rob.

1342
01:28:44,384 --> 01:28:46,595
We can't carry them.

1343
01:28:47,846 --> 01:28:49,931
That's not possible.

1344
01:28:50,056 --> 01:28:51,683
He's good.

1345
01:28:53,018 --> 01:28:54,936
It's going to take all of your...

1346
01:28:54,936 --> 01:28:57,147
just to get ourselves down.

1347
01:28:59,357 --> 01:29:01,359
Oh, damn it.

1348
01:29:05,614 --> 01:29:08,617
Helen, it's Mike here.
Do you copy?

1349
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:11,244
Come in, Mike.
What do you got?

1350
01:29:11,244 --> 01:29:14,039
Yasuko and Beck,

1351
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:16,666
did not make it back to camp.

1352
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:23,757
Okay, Mike.
Thanks for letting us know.

1353
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:00,168
Meg.

1354
01:30:02,754 --> 01:30:04,256
Bud.

1355
01:30:36,872 --> 01:30:39,249
Hello, Base Camp.
Hello, Base Camp.

1356
01:30:39,332 --> 01:30:41,084
Hello, Base Camp.

1357
01:30:41,918 --> 01:30:43,795
Ang Dorjee, this is Helen.

1358
01:30:43,795 --> 01:30:46,047
We have to turn back!

1359
01:30:46,089 --> 01:30:49,217
There is a very bad storm again.

1360
01:30:49,968 --> 01:30:52,095
- Your call, Ang Dorjee.
- Sorry.

1361
01:30:52,095 --> 01:30:55,265
We'll try it again,
when the storm pass.

1362
01:30:55,265 --> 01:30:57,476
We'll leave some tea
and oxygen here.

1363
01:30:57,476 --> 01:30:59,019
Sorry.

1364
01:31:05,609 --> 01:31:08,278
We have to tell Rob
they're not coming.

1365
01:31:09,446 --> 01:31:10,947
Okay.

1366
01:31:19,706 --> 01:31:20,999
Hey, Rob.
It's Guy, mate.

1367
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:22,667
Guy.

1368
01:31:24,419 --> 01:31:28,173
Can't stop shaking, Guy.

1369
01:31:28,465 --> 01:31:31,384
Boys hit a bit of a high wind.
And...

1370
01:31:31,426 --> 01:31:34,387
your best shot is going
to be to get lower.

1371
01:31:37,224 --> 01:31:39,559
Let me think about it.

1372
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,856
Don't think I can hang out
here another night.

1373
01:31:49,736 --> 01:31:52,364
Which will I get first thing, okay.

1374
01:33:01,016 --> 01:33:02,267
Helen?

1375
01:33:02,267 --> 01:33:03,643
Yeah.

1376
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,188
Yeah, he's still there.

1377
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:09,900
He's just below the South Summit.

1378
01:33:10,233 --> 01:33:12,944
He's got oxygen
but...

1379
01:33:12,944 --> 01:33:14,946
it's iced up.

1380
01:33:14,946 --> 01:33:17,866
We don't know whether
he's been able to free it.

1381
01:33:20,285 --> 01:33:22,287
Is anybody with him?

1382
01:33:22,287 --> 01:33:23,788
No.

1383
01:33:24,206 --> 01:33:25,749
No.

1384
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:29,795
You have to get him down before dark.
He won't survive another night.

1385
01:33:29,961 --> 01:33:31,588
We know.

1386
01:33:32,798 --> 01:33:36,468
But the storms come back,
real bad.

1387
01:33:36,927 --> 01:33:39,971
We can't get anyone
up to him tonight.

1388
01:33:39,971 --> 01:33:41,848
We tried.

1389
01:33:45,185 --> 01:33:47,646
He might as well be on the moon.

1390
01:33:50,357 --> 01:33:51,608
Uh.

1391
01:33:53,568 --> 01:33:55,904
Can you put me on
with him again?

1392
01:33:55,946 --> 01:33:57,739
Of course.

1393
01:34:00,659 --> 01:34:03,119
Guy.
Get Rob.

1394
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:09,167
Hi, Rob.
It's Guy.

1395
01:34:10,126 --> 01:34:12,295
I've got Jan for you.

1396
01:34:12,838 --> 01:34:14,339
Hold on.

1397
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,675
Give me a second.

1398
01:34:31,022 --> 01:34:32,858
Okay.

1399
01:34:41,241 --> 01:34:43,535
Hi, sweetheart.

1400
01:34:44,202 --> 01:34:46,371
How are you?

1401
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:51,042
I'm thinking about you.

1402
01:34:54,921 --> 01:34:56,882
Please say, "I'm good."

1403
01:34:59,134 --> 01:35:01,386
Are you warm, my love.

1404
01:35:02,053 --> 01:35:04,890
I might have a little frostbite.

1405
01:35:06,725 --> 01:35:09,936
I'm looking forward
to making it all better.

1406
01:35:12,564 --> 01:35:15,358
I'm waiting for you
to come home.

1407
01:35:18,069 --> 01:35:20,405
How's Sarah?

1408
01:35:20,489 --> 01:35:22,240
Sarah?

1409
01:35:22,657 --> 01:35:24,701
Yeah.

1410
01:35:25,744 --> 01:35:28,079
Yes, Sarah is good.

1411
01:35:29,581 --> 01:35:32,250
Will you call her that for me?

1412
01:35:32,542 --> 01:35:34,419
Yes, I will.

1413
01:35:37,005 --> 01:35:40,425
I don't think I'm going
to get to meet her.

1414
01:35:43,553 --> 01:35:46,181
I'm so sorry.

1415
01:35:50,268 --> 01:35:52,312
Don't say that.

1416
01:35:54,189 --> 01:35:56,942
If anyone can make it, you can.

1417
01:35:56,942 --> 01:35:58,610
Remember.

1418
01:36:02,364 --> 01:36:04,324
I love you.

1419
01:36:05,617 --> 01:36:08,829
Please don't worry too much.

1420
01:36:14,584 --> 01:36:17,212
Good bye, my love.

1421
01:36:30,308 --> 01:36:32,769
I love you, Rob.

1422
01:36:36,273 --> 01:36:38,108
I love you.

1423
01:38:20,877 --> 01:38:24,548
(Come on.)
(Come on.)

1424
01:38:38,061 --> 01:38:40,355
(Come on, Dad.)

1425
01:40:01,812 --> 01:40:03,480
Beck.

1426
01:40:06,525 --> 01:40:08,693
Helen, it's Mike here.

1427
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:11,071
Helen, do you copy?

1428
01:40:11,112 --> 01:40:12,906
Mike, come in.

1429
01:40:12,948 --> 01:40:14,741
Beck's still alive.

1430
01:40:14,783 --> 01:40:16,910
He walked himself into camp.

1431
01:40:19,412 --> 01:40:22,374
I got to get him down to Camp 1.

1432
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:25,544
Thanks, Mike.

1433
01:40:29,214 --> 01:40:33,426
We don't even know how,
but he is alive.

1434
01:40:33,718 --> 01:40:35,387
Thing is, Peach,

1435
01:40:35,387 --> 01:40:37,139
we can't get him down the Icefall.

1436
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:38,598
Oh no.
I'll get him down.

1437
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:40,809
- I'll get him down. Okay.
- Dad.

1438
01:40:40,851 --> 01:40:43,854
Okay, what do we need?
We need a helicopter, right?

1439
01:40:43,895 --> 01:40:48,859
Yeah, but they can't a helicopter up
that high because the air is too thin.

1440
01:40:48,900 --> 01:40:51,862
We should try, but it is
one heck of a rescue.

1441
01:40:51,862 --> 01:40:53,738
And he's not in a
good way, Peach.  So...

1442
01:40:53,738 --> 01:40:56,700
I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

1443
01:41:01,538 --> 01:41:03,290
1 step at a time.

1444
01:41:06,543 --> 01:41:07,752
- You got to keep moving.
- I'm tired.

1445
01:41:07,794 --> 01:41:09,254
- I know.
- I'm tired.

1446
01:41:09,254 --> 01:41:11,673
I know you are.
I know you are. Come on.

1447
01:41:13,383 --> 01:41:15,260
Slow and steady.

1448
01:41:16,678 --> 01:41:18,763
Come on, keep moving.

1449
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:23,768
Yes, I like the number of the
American Embassy in Kathmandu, Nepal.

1450
01:41:23,935 --> 01:41:25,020
Yes, Nepal.

1451
01:41:25,061 --> 01:41:27,564
Ambassador, please.
No. Sweets, I can't hold.

1452
01:41:27,606 --> 01:41:28,773
No.
You listen, sir.

1453
01:41:28,815 --> 01:41:31,776
My husband has already died once
as you've seen on the news.

1454
01:41:31,818 --> 01:41:36,198
Trust me. Having him die a second
time is not going to play well on CNN.

1455
01:41:36,323 --> 01:41:38,742
There we go, buddy.

1456
01:41:39,284 --> 01:41:41,661
That's it, alright.

1457
01:41:42,454 --> 01:41:45,540
Camp 2

1458
01:41:46,249 --> 01:41:48,627
- Beck.
- Uh-huh.

1459
01:41:49,461 --> 01:41:50,587
How're you doing?

1460
01:41:50,629 --> 01:41:53,340
Oh, you know,
third amendment.

1461
01:41:53,632 --> 01:41:55,217
Warm enough?

1462
01:41:56,051 --> 01:41:58,011
I'm not sure yet.

1463
01:41:58,470 --> 01:42:00,639
Look like you are,
a little bit.

1464
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:04,893
How's Rob doing?

1465
01:42:07,646 --> 01:42:10,315
Rob's still up there right now.

1466
01:42:12,484 --> 01:42:15,111
And Doug,
what's he up to?

1467
01:42:19,699 --> 01:42:21,660
Doug's gone, Beck.

1468
01:42:37,509 --> 01:42:40,220
I don't know. No one's ever try
to fly higher than Base Camp before.

1469
01:42:40,262 --> 01:42:42,180
They gonna give it a go.

1470
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:44,683
Just find an LZ. Just make up
with whatever you can.

1471
01:42:44,683 --> 01:42:46,351
Okay.
Worth a try.

1472
01:42:46,351 --> 01:42:47,769
Thanks, Guy.

1473
01:42:47,811 --> 01:42:49,646
Grab a Gatorade.
Got a chopper coming in.

1474
01:42:49,688 --> 01:42:51,273
We need to make a LZ

1475
01:42:51,314 --> 01:42:53,859
We got a chopper coming in!

1476
01:42:54,526 --> 01:42:57,070
- Clear the rope back to the tents!
- Okay.

1477
01:42:57,112 --> 01:42:58,196
Thanks.

1478
01:42:58,196 --> 01:43:00,782
Keep it clear.
Keep this whole area clear.

1479
01:43:01,449 --> 01:43:03,076
Come on.
Come on.

1480
01:43:17,966 --> 01:43:20,051
You can't pause zipping.

1481
01:43:20,427 --> 01:43:23,096
You land here,
we'll never get back up.

1482
01:43:29,352 --> 01:43:31,646
Okay, Major, let's go back.

1483
01:43:50,081 --> 01:43:52,334
- That's it.
- Can't get any more out.

1484
01:43:52,375 --> 01:43:54,544
it's as light as
we're going to get it.

1485
01:43:55,629 --> 01:43:58,423
- Tango to Charlie.
- Tango to Charlie.

1486
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:11,645
Right here!
Right here!

1487
01:44:13,772 --> 01:44:16,274
Come on!
Come closer!

1488
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:45,887
Come, Beck.

1489
01:44:45,929 --> 01:44:47,472
Right there.

1490
01:44:50,308 --> 01:44:52,102
Okay.
Come on.

1491
01:44:54,688 --> 01:44:55,856
Get closer.

1492
01:44:55,897 --> 01:44:58,650
- Only 1 hand, sir.
- Just hand, just 1.

1493
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:01,236
- Alright.
- There you go.

1494
01:45:04,489 --> 01:45:05,949
You good?

1495
01:45:06,283 --> 01:45:09,452
I'm going to lift the tail up.
Flies over the edge.

1496
01:45:11,788 --> 01:45:14,040
- Is that okay with you?
- I'm with you.

1497
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:15,834
Good, man.

1498
01:46:22,442 --> 01:46:24,653
It's alright.

1499
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,702
I'm so sorry, Helen.

1500
01:46:33,078 --> 01:46:35,455
Come on.
Let's get you inside.

1501
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,854
Hi, Peachy.

1502
01:47:03,441 --> 01:47:04,860
Beck.

1503
01:47:17,622 --> 01:47:20,000
Thank you so much, darling.

1504
01:47:40,395 --> 01:47:42,731
Oh, Jan.
I'm so sorry.

1505
01:48:11,259 --> 01:48:20,393
Rob's body remains on the mountain
with the others who lost their lives.

Beck Weathers lost both his hands and nose.

1512
01:49:03,228 --> 01:49:07,649
He still lives in Dallas with his wife, Peach.

1513
01:49:09,442 --> 01:49:14,781
In July 1996, Jan gave birth to a baby.

1514
01:49:16,491 --> 01:49:21,997
Giving the name "Sarah".
